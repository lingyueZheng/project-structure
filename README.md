#Project 1: HTML Structure
##Due: Friday, February 13, 3 p.m.


###Instructions

Create an HTML version of your résumé using valid HTML5 and best practices.

You have the freedom to be creative in how you present your résumé. It should, however, take into account which part(s) of your résumé are the most important content-wise, be marked up in a way which describes the content and organized using HTML5 structural tags.

This assignment is worth **15 points.**

###Requirements

We will be looking for a well-structured document, including:

- Valid HTML (checked using the [W3C HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/))
- Presence of HTML5 structural tags (i.e. `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Proper use of hierarchical (`h1-h6`) tags
- Properly encoded HTML entities
- Use of appropriate tags for marking up content
- No use of presentational elements in HTML

To demonstrate proficiency using hypertext, the document must include:

- At least one external link
- A navigational (`nav`) element provides a menu for each section of the résumé


###Submission

By now you should have all required software installed on your computer and familiarity with the command line and git.

You should also have an account on GitHub and have worked through tutorials to create your GitHub Pages repository (`<username>.github.io`).

Only one file -- `resume.html` -- is required for this assignment. You are to commit your résumé as `resume.html` to your `<username>.github.io` repo.

**[Create an issue](https://github.com/um-cvj-341-spring-2015/project-structure/issues) in this repo with *your name* and a link to your *username.github.io* repo by the deadline If you are unsure of how to submit, check the example provided in the Issues section.**

Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.


###Grading

**One quarter of a point (0.25) will be be deducted for each missing requirement** as stated above, inclusion of presentational elements, broken links, spelling errors or omission of best practices as specified during lectures.

Failure to submit the assignment to GitHub as detailed above will result in a **five (5) point deduction**. This includes an incorrect repo name and/or file name.

A missed deadline (submitting the assignment, for instance, at 3:00:01 p.m.) will result in a **two (2) point deduction for every day the assignment is late**.

**Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council**.

**Good luck!**
